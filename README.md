An application demonstrating the features offered by Nubank's [Nuvigator](https://github.com/nubank/nuvigator) package.

> Nuvigator provides a powerful routing abstraction over Flutter's own Navigators. Model complex navigation flows using a mostly declarative and concise approach, without needing to worry about several tricky behaviors that Nuvigator handles for you.
